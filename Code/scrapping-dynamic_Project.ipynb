            "The high number of accidents has led police to identify a 400-metre stretch at this square as a black spot this year. The traffic police themselves identified the stretch at this square as a black spot but no action has been taken to address the traffic problems plaguing this area. Road markings, functional CCTV cameras and speed reduction measures are all but absent.\n",
            "Although the previously dysfunctional traffic signals at this intersection were recently restored ahead of the Global Investors Summit (GIS), senior traffic cops stress the urgent need for speed reduction measures to be implemented to curb further road accidents. Traffic officials highlighted that during night hours, when traffic signals cease to function, vehicles tend to speed through the square unchecked, significantly increasing the risk of collisions.\n",
            "They emphasised that without proper control measures, the location will continue to be a high-risk zone.\n",
            "Traffic cops, wishing anonymity, said that youngsters overspeed their bikes on this stretch of road in the absence of any police checking and lack of any CCTV surveillance, and accidents occur. Despite its reputation as a high-risk zone, no action is being taken by the concerned road construction agencies. Traffic police repeatedly wrote letters to the authorities concerned to address the issue, but no concrete steps were taken. Now that the traffic signals are operational, the traffic cops are hopeful that further measures will be taken to make the spot safe.\n",
            "Traffic cops maintained that to improve safety at Atal Path Square, road markings and rumble strips must be constructed to control vehicle speed. Additionally, functional CCTV cameras are essential to monitor traffic violations, particularly the frequent red-light jumping observed in the absence of cops at the square.\n",
            "Road engineering experts maintained that vehicles approach this square at high speed from Atal Path (Jawahar Chowk side), New Market, and Mata Mandir side, which makes it accident-prone. Speed reduction measures should be made at this junction to control the speed of vehicles approaching the square. It can be done by setting up speed breakers or rumble strips. A senior traffic cop said that there is a slope on the road approaching from Jawahar Chowk, due to which vehicles roll down at high speed.\n",
            "In the absence of any speed control measures, accidents occur. There is a need to construct speed control measures on all four sides of this square. Apart from that, proper road markings should be done, and CCTV cameras should be installed. Road studs that blink at night should be fitted.\n",
            "Additional DCP (Traffic) Basant Koul said that especially during night hours, when the traffic signals do not function, vehicles tend to overspeed at the Atal Path Square from all the approaching roads. To check this overspeeding, speed control/reduction measures need to be taken on an immediate basis.\n",
            "DCP (Traffic) Sanjay Singh said that traffic signals fitted at the Atal Path/Platinum Plaza Square became operational recently before the GIS, but still, the speed reduction measures like setting up rumble strips need to be installed to control overspeeding at the square.\n",
            "Traffic police have already written a letter to the construction agency concerned to take the necessary measures to rectify the problems at the square at the earliest on top priority.\n",
            "Once the speed reduction measures and road signages are installed at this square, it will help in controlling speed. It will be an effective measure to control road accidents at this spot. Traffic police will once again request the authorities to take the measures. Casualties in road accidents in the city increased by almost 20 percent in 2024 compared to road accident casualties reported in 2023. In 2024, 235 people lost their lives in 2,900 road accidents, while 2,223 people were injured, as per the data compiled by Bhopal Traffic Police. In 2023, 198 people were killed in 2,906 road accidents, while 2,196 were injured.\n",

            "The accident took place on Sunday night near Kuppahalli in Bangarpet, Kolar district. A SUV lost control and collided with high intensity with a two-wheeler driving in the opposite direction. The victims of the crash were identified as Mahesh (45), the SUV driver; Ratnamma (60), a relative seated in the front; Udvitha (2), and an unidentified motorcyclist, all of whom died on the spot.\n",
            "Four other passengers in the SUV suffered injuries and were rushed to nearby hospitals in Kolar Gold Fields for medical attention. The family, residents of Kammasandra in KGF, was returning from Bengaluru when the tragic incident occurred.\n",
            "The Bengaluru-Chennai Expressway is about 260 km. It links Bengaluru with Sriperumbudur near Chennai and is designed for high-speed travel. The 68-km stretch in Karnataka, which opened to traffic last month, is yet to be officially inaugurated. The highway is built to accommodate a maximum speed of 120 km/h, promoting faster travel across the region.\n",
            "The expressway is considered a major infrastructure project, touted as South Indiaâs first greenfield expressway, with a total cost of â¹17,900 crore. Once fully operational, it is expected to reduce the travel time between Bengaluru and Chennai from seven hours to just three. The stretch already sees a daily footfall of around 1,600 to 2,000 vehicles, and motorists use a village road to exit and reach Mulbagal and the Andhra Pradesh border.\n",
            "The tragic incident has led to heightened concerns over the safety of the expressway, particularly for two-wheeler riders. In response to the accident, NHAI has decided to impose a ban on two-wheelers to prevent further incidents, especially given the high-speed nature of the highway. The move underscores the importance of road safety and the need for strict enforcement of traffic regulations.\n",
