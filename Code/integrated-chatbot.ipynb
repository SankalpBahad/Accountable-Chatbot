The ruling came in a criminal appeal case.\\nGendre was convicted by the 7th Additional Sessions Judge, Raipur, for offences under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 364 (kidnapping for murder), and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The trial court had sentenced him to death for the murder, along with other terms of imprisonment for kidnapping.\\nA Division Bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Ravindra Kumar Agrawal noted, â\\x80\\x9cBefore awarding capital punishment, the Court has to strike a balance between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances viz. mental and emotional condition, age, possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of the accused, brutality and the manner in which the offence is committed, which makes the case fall under the category of rarest of rare case and death penalty would be the only appropriate and meaningful sentence.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe case stemmed from the events of April 5, 2022, when Gendre took two minor sons of his neighbor, Pushpa Chetan, under the pretext of visiting local sites. He returned one child but then proceeded to murder the 4-year-old Harsh Kumar Chetan by pouring petrol on him and setting him ablaze.\\nThe murder was an act of vengeance against the child's mother for spurning his advances. This was Raipur's first death sentence in 46 years.\\nThe court acknowledged the heinous nature of the crime, describing it as â\\x80\\x9cbarbaric,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cinhuman,â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cextremely shocking and cruel.â\\x80\\x9d They also noted the vulnerability of the victim, a â\\x80\\x9cdefenceless childâ\\x80\\x9d under the age of five.\\nHowever, the court also found several procedural lapses in the trial court's decision, including hasty sentencing, lack of reformative consideration, inadequate consideration of socio-economic factors, insufficient hearing on sentencing, and absence of evidence on irreformability.\\nThe High Court emphasized that while the crime was undeniably horrific, it did not meet the â\\x80\\x9crarest of rareâ\\x80\\x9d criteria necessary for a death sentence. They highlighted Gendreâ\\x80\\x99s age (35 at the time of the offence), his lack of prior criminal record, and the absence of evidence indicating he posed a continuing threat to society.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUpon thoughtful consideration, we are of the view that an extreme sentence of death penalty is not warranted in the facts and circumstances of the case,â\\x80\\x9d the court stated. â\\x80\\x9cWe are of the opinion that imprisonment for life would be completely adequate and would meet ends of justice accordingly.â\\x80\\x9d\\nWhile upholding his conviction under Section 302 of the IPC, the High Court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. Importantly, the court ordered that this life sentence must extend to the â\\x80\\x9cremainder of natural lifeâ\\x80\\x9d of Gendre, effectively ruling out any possibility of parole or remission. The convictions and sentences for kidnapping were upheld and ordered to run concurrently with the life sentence.\\n\"}]"

      "\n",
      "* **Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302 (Murder):**  This section addresses the offense of murder.  While the provided texts don't explicitly detail the punishment for a minor committing murder under this section,  news articles illustrate that minors can be charged with murder and that sentences can range from life imprisonment (possibly without parole) to death (though death sentences are subject to review and potential commutation).  The sentencing considers mitigating and aggravating circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Age of the Accused:** The age of the minor committing the murder is a crucial factor influencing the legal proceedings and sentencing.  The IPC Section 305 regarding abetment of suicide by a minor indicates that the age of the accused (under 18) impacts the potential penalties.  Cases involving minors often require specialized juvenile justice procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sentencing Considerations:**  Sentencing for murder, even when committed by a minor, is determined by the court based on several factors, including the severity of the crime, the age of the accused, the presence of mitigating circumstances (like lack of prior record or remorse), and aggravating circumstances (like the brutality of the crime).  News articles show that death sentences are possible but often subject to review and commutation to life imprisonment without parole.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Juvenile Justice Procedures:**  Minors accused of crimes are typically handled under juvenile justice laws, which may differ from the procedures for adult offenders. The specific legal framework and sentencing options vary by jurisdiction.\n"
