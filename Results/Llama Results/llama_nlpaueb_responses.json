The police registered an offence and are searching for the truck driver.

The case was registered under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. * In another case, [Ramanjit Singh](#ramanjit-singh), a student, was able to withdraw a cheque bounce case against him after the Punjab State Scheduled Castes Commission intervened. ### Consequences of Possessing a Counterfeit Cheque * Possessing a counterfeit cheque can lead to legal consequences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). * The relevant sections under the IPC are: * Section 242: Possession of counterfeit coin by a person who knew it to be counterfeit when he became possessed thereof. * Section 243: Possession of Indian coin by a person who knew it to be counterfeit when he became possessed thereof. * The punishment for possessing a counterfeit cheque under Section 242 can range from imprisonment for a term up to three years, or with a fine which may extend to the value of the counterfeit coin, or with both. * In addition to the above, the court may also direct the accused to pay the amount of the counterfeit coin to the complainant. * For example, in the case of [Rahul Khabiya](#rahul-khabiya), a serial fraudster, was accused of duping a bullion trader of over Rs 1 crore by issuing counterfeit cheques. ### Consequences of Cheque Bounce in Business Transactions * Cheque bounce can lead to serious consequences in business transactions, including loss of reputation and financial losses. * In the case of [Huma Khan](#huma-khan), a woman was defrauded of over Rs 1.3 crore by a couple who tricked her into believing they needed financial help and later promised to invest her money in real estate. * The couple issued cheques to Huma, but they bounced due to insufficient funds. * Huma alleged that the couple and their brother were involved in the fraud and threatened her with dire consequences. ### Consequences of Cheque Bounce in Personal Transactions * Cheque bounce can also lead to serious consequences in personal transactions, including emotional distress and financial losses. * In the case of [Jamila Solanki](#jamila-solanki), a 50-year-old woman was cheated of Rs 6.10 lakh in the booking of her haj pilgrimage. * The accused, Saheb Rana, issued a cheque to Jamila, but it bounced. ### Legal Remedies * In case of a cheque bounce, the complainant can file a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. * The court may direct the accused to pay the amount of the cheque to the complainant. * In some cases, the court may also impose a fine on the accused.
